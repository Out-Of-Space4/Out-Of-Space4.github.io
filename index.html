     <p id = "info">Are you thinking about planning a trip to Mars? <br> Well you've come to the right place! Mars is the<br> the 4th planet from the sun. It also about 224.32<br> km away from the sun. It is <strong> very </strong>cold you so you <br>might wanna a bring a few jackets to keep you <br>warm. Mars is made up of nickel, iron, and <br>sulphur. If you do go to Mars you might wanna<br> keep a look out for these 2 moons named Deimos <br> and Phobos. If you're courageous you can even<br> stay <strong>1 whole year</strong> on Mars which is about 687 earth days. If you're not feeling too sure about traveling to Mars you can take the free trial of 1 week and we will still provide everyday necessities such as food, water, safety, a suit which has all the oxygen you will need for your trip so you can enjoy your trip with no worries whatsoever
