        <p> Hello everyone! I'm very excited that you are thinking about traveling with us! <strong><em>Out of Space</em></strong> was originally launched by Poonam Dhillon.  </p>
        
        
       <h2 id = "mars">Mars</h2>
     
        <p class= "info">Are you thinking about planning a trip to Mars? Well you've come to the right place! Mars is the the 4th planet from the sun. It also about 224.32 km away from the sun. It is <strong> very </strong>cold you so you might wanna a bring a few jackets to keep you warm. Mars is made up of nickel, iron, and sulphur. If you do go to Mars you might wanna keep a look out for these 2 moons named Deimos  and Phobos. If you're courageous you can even stay <strong>1 whole year</strong> on Mars which is about 687 earth days. If you're not feeling too sure about traveling to Mars you can take the free trial of 1 week(175 earth hours) and we will still provide everyday necessities such as food, water, safety, a suit which has all the oxygen you will need for your trip so you can enjoy your trip with no worries whatsoever :) 
     </p>
    
    <p> Some activities you could enjoy on Mars are:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Spaceboarding(Surfing with low gravity)
          <li>Starfishing(fishing for stars)
          <li> Laydown and just enjoy this beautiful sight because many people won't get the chance to
          <li>Take advantage of the low gravity!
          <li>Have fun!
      </ul>

   <h2 id="neptune">Neptune</h2>
   
   <p class="info">Neptune is the 8th planet from the sun which is also the farthest of all planets. Neptune is made up of water, methane and ammonia. Neptune has 14 moons. I will list them below after the rest of the info. A 125lb person on earth would be 147lbs on neptune. Neptunes weather is brutally cold. The averege temperature is -200 celsius. You <strong>NEED</strong> to make sure you wear lots and lots of layers so you dont freeze to death. We will not allow you to go on this tour unless you are were enough layers cause your safety is our first priority. If you're courageous you can even stay <strong>1 whole year</strong> on Neptune which is about 60,225 earth days. If you're not feeling too sure about traveling to Neptune you can take the free trial of 1 week(112 earth hours) and we will still provide everyday necessities such as food, water, safety,a suit which has all the oxygen you will need for your trip so you can enjoy your trip with no worries whatsover:)   </p>

            <p class="info">If your reading this it probably means your thinking that a tour on a comet would be really cool and trust me, it is! A comet is about the size of a small town. Comets are made up of dust, rock, and ice. Comets are found in the Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud. They are sometimes called "cosmic snowballs" or "dirty snowballs". Right now, scientists have found exactly 3,743 comets in space.  </p>
